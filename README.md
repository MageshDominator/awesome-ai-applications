### AI: The Big¬†Picture
Artificial Intelligence and Data Science are multi-disciplinary and are a wide field that aims at replicating human intelligence or at least a specific part of it through machines.

As mentioned earlier, Data science and AI are too broad, and to achieve the expectations of AI i.e "giving machines the ability to learn and perform specific tasks on their own" we have Machine Learning which is a subset of AI.

</p>

**Machine learning needs 3 major components to achieve its goal:**
* **Data:** This is the most important part of any AI pipeline and it can be anything like Quantitative, Categorical, Text, Image, Audio 
* **Features:** Features are important pieces of data that help us in solving the task at hand
* **Algorithms:** Algorithms are specific mathematical models that learn patterns from the features thereby developing the ability to generalize to the problem at hand.

</p>

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine learning which is inspired by the neural structure and functioning of the brain. Deep learning uses complex multi-layered neural networks to learn feature representations automatically and proven to be more successful for Unstructured data like Image, Text, Audio.

There are 3 major types of Machine learning:¬†
* **Supervised Learning(task-driven):** Learns the relationship between input and the target variable
* **Unsupervised Learning(data-driven):** Learns, extract, and describe the relationship between data points
* **Reinforcement learning:** Agent learns to operate by exploring to maximize rewards using feedback.

Based on the nature and complexity of data and problems, various AI tasks and techniques can be applied. Here I'm just listing out some common types and each task itself a broad topic so if you're new to this give yourself some time to explore about various tasks that interests you,
* **Computer Vision:** Image Classification, Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, Face recognition, Image Reconstruction, and Style transfer
* **Natural Language Processing:** Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Question-Answering, Conversational bots, Speech recognition, Text-to-Speech generation, Semantic search, and so on.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Understanding the past, Forecast Trends, Risk Assessment, Anamoly Detection
* Classification and Regression problems involving Categorical and Quantitative data which are usually tackled with Feature Engineering and task-specific algorithms

### General use cases of AI: Business Agnostic¬†AI
With a huge amount of data and the evolution of AI algorithms, AI is impacting each and every business, here are some common use cases of AI that can be applied to typically any business,
* **Conversational AI:** This includes chatbots(typically text-based), voice assistants, and voice + text assistants. This is now everywhere from mobile phones (voice/virtual assistants) to customer service
* **Recommendation engines:** From Social media to e-commerce, e-learning, recommendation engines are very popular and are personalized and targeted towards end-users
* **Risk Assessment and Fraud Detection:** Most businesses use AI models to predict future trends, detect risk and fraud, and fraud prevention
* **Search Optimization:** AI-powered semantic search engines are everywhere and are personalized
* **Mobile Applications:** Every smartphone comes with in-built AI features like smart camera applications like image enhancement, gender and age identification, 3D facial recognition, smart intelligent assistants, typing suggestions like auto-correct, next-word suggestions. And most of the businesses are building AI-enabled applications to optimize the user experience.

### AI-First Companies
There are companies that advance on the use of AI and are focused on data collection, predictive modeling, and getting quantitative feedbacks from users. And not to mention most of the AI world depends and operates based on open-source research, data, algorithms from these companies.

***Companies that own most of the user's data and having better prediction models will dominate the industry and win the digital economy.***

Here are some companies that have declared themselves are AI-first and actually are(most companies/startups use AI-first as a buzzword‚Ää-‚Ääbeware of them üòê),

* **Google(Alphabet):** They not only have good company merger and acquisition strategy, but they also have the world's best data acquisition strategy. With their search engine, chrome, android, youtube, maps, email, photos, they've live feed of data from every individual(maybe not in Chinaüòù). And, Google is one of the companies to invest early in AI Research and made a lot of breakthroughs in AI Software and Hardware. Now they're selling great Enterprise AI products/solutions with their Google Cloud Platform
* **Amazon:** Amazon is not just an e-commerce company anymore, they're into Cloud Computing, Live streaming, AI products, Robotics, and so on. They also have great data and company acquisition strategies. They have great recommendation engines, ai assistant, cloud ai products/services, and robotics products
* **Facebook:** Most controversial company in terms of privacy, and manipulation, they not only own WhatsApp and Instagram, but they also own crucial data of users from their platforms. Facebook AI (FAIR) has made great contributions to the open-source AI community
* **Microsoft:** They own Linkedin, Skype, Github, Microsoft office suite which are great sources of data, and Microsoft being a great player in the Enterprise Cloud Computing Platform has done a lot of breakthroughs in AI and now providing Enterprise AI solutions at scale.

The above companies are not the only AI-first companies, I have used them because they're more popular and easy to convey their data acquisition and modeling strategies. There are other companies that are also AI-first and popular like Tesla, Uber, Netflix, Alibaba, etc..
